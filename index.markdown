title: About Me
---

I am a fifth-year PhD student in the QCD Theory group at Duke University. My advisor is Dr. Thomas Mehen, whose research focuses on effective field theories for hadronic physics. I am currently studying systems with heavy quarks using effective theories such as Non-Relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics (NRQCD), Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET), and an effective field theory for the X(3872) (XEFT).  I plan to graduate in Spring 2024 and seek a position as a postdoctoral research associate.
