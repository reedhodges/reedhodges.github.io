Below I list four projects I have worked on in my career since the start of undergrad.  #1 is a toy project designed as an avenue through which to broaden my skills in Python and scikit-learn.  The rest are my broadly-defined three academic research projects, one from undergrad and two from grad school.  Each of these three projects resulted in two papers for a grand total of six papers, four of which are currently published in peer-reviewed journals, with the other two currently undergoing the review process. 

Projects #1 and #2 have dedicated pages on this website, showcasing skills and discussing their compuational aspects.  Click on their titles to learn more.

### 1. [J/psi production](proj-1.markdown)
A **work-in-progress** portfolio project attempting to learn about the phase space of various J/psi production mechanisms, demonstrating skills in the Python libraries numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn.

### 1. [SQL basketball stats project](sql-proj.markdown)

Github repository: [[1](https://github.com/reedhodges/bball_league)]

### 2. [Transverse momentum dependence in J/psi production](mathematica-proj.markdown)

Collaborators: Marston Copeland, Sean Fleming, Rohit Gupta, Thomas Mehen

Github repositories: [[1](https://github.com/reedhodges/JPsi_TMDFFs), [2](https://github.com/reedhodges/JPsi_Production_NRQCD)]
Links to papers: [[1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08605), [2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.13737)]
 
- Calculated for the first time the 36 spin-dependent quark and gluon fragmentation functions at leading order in the strong coupling 
- Derived cross sections for unpolarized, longitudinally polarized, and transversely polarized J/psi production via color octet photon-gluon fusion, using NRQCD factorization
- Compared the production of J/psi via quark fragmentation and photon-gluon fusion in different regions of phase space, to identify regimes to extract gluon TMDs and the color octet <sup>3</sup>S<sub>1</sub> matrix element

### 3. Decays of the exotic meson T<sub>cc</sub><sup>+</sup>

Collaborators: Lin Dai, Sean Fleming, Thomas Mehen

Links to papers: [[1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.02188), [2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.11950)]

Academic research project that also resulted in two papers, on the decay of the T<sub>cc</sub><sup>+</sup> exotic meson, discovered by LHCb in 2021. 
- Generalized the effective field theory for the X(3872), XEFT, to the case of the T<sub>cc</sub><sup>+</sup>  
- Predicted the decay width and the differential decay distributions, with excellent agreement with the experimental results
- Estimated uncertainties due to next-leading-order contributions
- The agreement of data with our effective field theory model suggest a molecular interpretation for the meson
- Results cast doubt on the existence of a shallow bound state of pseudoscalar charm mesons, to which the T<sub>cc</sub><sup>+</sup> could decay

### 4. Invisibility of a metamaterial microsphere

Collaborators: Cleon Dean, Maxim Durach, Kelvin Rosado-Ayala

Links to papers: [[1](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1612/1612.00268.pdf), [2](http://shodor.org/media/content/jocse/volume8/issue3/hodges_final.pdf)]

- Simulated the optical properties of a wavelength-sized sphere consisting of concentric spheres of metal and dielectric
- Showed that increasing the metal fraction of the microsphere from all-dielectric to all-metal leads to a transitionary stage where the scattering cross section is negligible
- Rewrote our simulation code using Fortran and parallel computing, demonstrating significant speedup
