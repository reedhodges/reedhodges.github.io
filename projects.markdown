# Academic research

Below I briefly discuss my various research projects over the course of my studies, listing their key accomplishments. More information about my publications can be found on [my INSPIRE-HEP page](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1920819) or [my Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gZonGgEAAAAJ&hl=en).

## Transverse momentum dependence in J/psi production

Collaborators: Marston Copeland, Sean Fleming, Rohit Gupta, Thomas Mehen

Github repositories: [(1)](https://github.com/reedhodges/JPsi_TMDFFs), [(2)](https://github.com/reedhodges/JPsi_Production_NRQCD)

We wrote two papers, broadly about transverse momentum dependence in J/psi production. 
- We calculated for the first time the 36 spin-dependent quark and gluon fragmentation functions at leading order in the strong coupling 
- We derived cross sections for unpolarized, longitudinally polarized, and transversely polarized J/psi production via color octet photon-gluon fusion, using NRQCD factorization
- We compared the production of J/psi via quark fragmentation and photon-gluon fusion in different regions of phase space, to identify regimes to extract gluon TMDs and the color octet <sup>3</sup>S<sub>1</sub> matrix element

## Decays of the exotic meson T<sub>cc</sub><sup>+</sup>

Collaborators: Lin Dai, Sean Fleming, Thomas Mehen

We wrote two papers on the decay of the T<sub>cc</sub><sup>+</sup> exotic meson, discovered by LHCb in 2021. 
- We generalized the effective field theory for the X(3872), XEFT, to the case of the T<sub>cc</sub><sup>+</sup>  
- Our prediction for the decay width and the differential decay distributions were in excellent agreement with the experimental results
- We estimated uncertainties due to next-leading-order contributions
- The agreement of data with our effective field theory model suggest a molecular interpretation for the meson
- We cast doubt on the existence of a shallow bound state of pseudoscalar charm mesons, to which the T<sub>cc</sub><sup>+</sup> could decay

## Invisibility of a metamaterial microsphere

Collaborators: Cleon Dean, Maxim Durach, Kelvin Rosado-Ayala

We wrote two papers simulating the optical properties of a wavelength-sized sphere consisting of concentric spheres of metal and dielectric.
- We showed that increasing the metal fraction of the microsphere from all-dielectric to all-metal leads to a transitionary stage where the scattering cross section is negligible
- We rewrote our simulation code using Fortran and parallel computing, demonstrating significant speedup
