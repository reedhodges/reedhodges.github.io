### Relevant Experience

**Graduate Research Assistant** <br>
*Duke University / Durham, NC / 2018-present*
- Analyzed large datasets from nuclear physics experiments using Python for use in theoretical modeling
- Encouraged transparency and reproducibility while managing the codebases on GitHub for 4 research projects
- Derived over 30 new probability density functions to explain a wide range of data from particle colliders, enabling the community at large to use the functions in other research projects
- Reduced runtimes from minutes to seconds by fine-tuning programs for symbolic and numerical computation in Mathematica
- Delivered oral research presentations at national and international seminars and conferences, communicating the methodology, results, and applications of research to both expert and non-expert audiences
- Co-authored 4 academic papers, playing a leading role in literature review, analysis, writing, and presentation
- Formulated a new model to predict the lifetime of a newly discovered particle with 98% accuracy, showing the validity of our model compared to competing models; earned the Goshaw Family Endowment in recognition of this work

<br>

**Undergraduate Research Assistant** <br>
*Georgia Southern University / Statesboro, GA / 2015-2018*
- Utilized parallel computing in Fortran and Mathematica to reduce runtimes by a factor of 16 for programs that modeled materials to better understand how they interact with light
- Used iterative testing and optimization techniques to identify a new design for a micrometer-sized material with near-invisibility when exposed to lasers, reducing light scattering by over a factor of 10
- Collaborated with interdisciplinary teams to translate complex scientific concepts into accessible presentations, which were delivered regional and national conferences

<br>

**Blue Waters Petascale Computing Intern** <br>
*Shodor Education Foundation / 2016-2017*
- Enabled more complex simulations and reduced project timelines by developing Fortran programs for modeling the electromagnetic properties of small objects, achieving runtimes over 300 times faster than existing code
- Transitioned the computation in my undergraduate research to utilize parallelization on GPUs
