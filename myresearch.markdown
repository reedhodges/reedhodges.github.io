My research interests are in effective theories for the strong interaction.  The overarching theory of the strong interaction is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which describes the interactions of quarks and gluons.  It can be complicated to perform calculations in QCD, so it can be useful and instructive to work instead with approximations in a particular limit; the resulting theories are called effective field theories (EFTs).  Specifically, I have been interested in EFTs for systems with heavy quarks.

I have experience working with the following EFTs:

- XEFT: an effective field theory originally developed to describe the exotic meson X(3872), which is a bound state of a neutral D meson and its antiparticle, one of which is in an excited spin state.  My collaborators and I adapted the theory to describe the exotic meson T<sub>cc</sub><sup>+</sup>, which replaces the neutral D antiparticle with a charged D meson.
- NRQCD: an effective theory for systems with heavy quarks which are treated nonrelativistically.
- SCET: an effective theory with degrees of freedom that can be soft (i.e. relatively low-energy) or collinear (i.e. with momenta mostly along a particular direction).  These conditions might occur, for example, in a particle collider.
