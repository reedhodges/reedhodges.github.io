<p>Below I list four projects I have worked on in my career since the start of undergrad. #1 is a toy project designed as an avenue through which to broaden my skills in Python and scikit-learn. The rest are my broadly-defined three academic research projects, one from undergrad and two from grad school. Each of these three projects resulted in two papers for a grand total of six papers, four of which are currently published in peer-reviewed journals, with the other two currently undergoing the review process.</p>

<p>Projects 1, 2, and 3 have dedicated pages on this website, showcasing skills and discussing their computational aspects. Click on their titles to learn more.</p>

<h3>1. <a href="sql-proj.markdown">SQL, Python, and Tableau basketball stats project</a></h3>
<p>A portfolio project where I generate statistics for a fake basketball league in Python, and run SQL queries against the resulting data. The data is visualized in a Tableau story.</p>

<h3>2. <a href="jpsi-ml-proj.markdown">J/ψ production ML project</a></h3>
<p>A <strong>work-in-progress</strong> portfolio project attempting to learn about the phase space of various J/ψ production mechanisms, demonstrating skills in the Python libraries numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn.</p>

<h3>3. <a href="mathematica-proj.markdown">Transverse momentum dependence in J/psi production</a></h3>
<p>Collaborators: Marston Copeland, Sean Fleming, Rohit Gupta, Thomas Mehen</p>
<p>Github repositories: <a href="https://github.com/reedhodges/JPsi_TMDFFs">[1]</a>, <a href="https://github.com/reedhodges/JPsi_Production_NRQCD">[2]</a></p>
<p>Links to papers: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08605">[1]</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.13737">[2]</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>Calculated for the first time the 36 spin-dependent quark and gluon fragmentation functions at leading order in the strong coupling</li>
  <li>Derived cross sections for unpolarized, longitudinally polarized, and transversely polarized J/psi production via color octet photon-gluon fusion, using NRQCD factorization</li>
  <li>Compared the production of J/psi via quark fragmentation and photon-gluon fusion in different regions of phase space, to identify regimes to extract gluon TMDs and the color octet <sup>3</sup>S<sub>1</sub> matrix element</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Decays of the exotic meson T<sub>cc</sub><sup>+</sup></h3>
<p>Collaborators: Lin Dai, Sean Fleming, Thomas Mehen</p>
<p>Links to papers: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.02188">[1]</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.11950">[2]</a></p>
<p>Academic research project that also resulted in two papers, on the decay of the T<sub>cc</sub><sup>+</sup> exotic meson, discovered by LHCb in 2021.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Generalized the effective field theory for the X(3872), XEFT, to the case of the T<sub>cc</sub><sup>+</sup></li>
  <li>Predicted the decay width and the differential decay distributions, with excellent agreement with the experimental results</li>
  <li>Estimated uncertainties due to next-leading-order contributions</li>
  <li>The agreement of data with our effective field theory model suggests a molecular interpretation for the meson</li>
  <li>Results cast doubt on the existence of a shallow bound state of pseudoscalar charm mesons, to which the T<sub>cc</sub><sup>+</sup> could decay</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Invisibility of a metamaterial microsphere</h3>
<p>Collaborators: Cleon Dean, Maxim Durach, Kelvin Rosado-Ayala</p>
<p>Links to papers: <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1612/1612.00268.pdf">[1]</a>, <a href="http://shodor.org/media/content/jocse/volume8/issue3/hodges_final.pdf">[2]</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>Simulated the optical properties of a wavelength-sized sphere consisting of concentric spheres of metal and dielectric</li>
  <li>Showed that increasing the metal fraction of the microsphere from all-dielectric to all-metal leads to a transitionary stage where the scattering cross section is negligible</li>
  <li>Rewrote our simulation code using Fortran and parallel computing, demonstrating significant speedup</li>
</ul>
