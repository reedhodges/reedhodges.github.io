## Using Mathematica for a nuclear/particle physics research project

My research projects as a PhD student have revolved around using effective field theories.  These are quantum field theories that are approximations to a more general theory, and are applicable to a particular set of problems.

Calculations in quantum field theory can be quite involved.  Calculus, linear algebra, group theory, and complex analysis all play a role.  Use of a computer program can make your life much easier.

My collaborators and I wrote two papers on J/psi production in an effective field theory called NRQCD.  The calculational work primarily focuses on the evaluation of Feynman diagrams, which are visual representations of a the interactions of subatomic particles.  Feynman diagrams have a mathematical expression associated with them, which contribute to the probability of that process occuring.

Below I outline some of the code we used to help evaluate a Feynman diagram, as well as produce plots that visualize our results.  The code was written in close collaboration with co-author Marston Copeland.
