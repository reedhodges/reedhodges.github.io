The J/psi meson is a particle consisting of a charm quark and charm antiquark. It was discovered in 1974 by two research groups, one at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and the other at Brookhaven National Laboratory. 

One of the processes in which a J/psi can be produced is called semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering. Here, an electron and a proton are collided at high speeds, which can cause the proton to break apart and produce other types of particles.
