## Exploratory Data Analysis

The initial exploratory data analysis for this project was done in a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.13737) published by me and my collaborators.  Look at Figure 4 from that paper:

Here, we are plotting the cross section (\[sigma]) differential in the transverse momentum of the J/psi, as a function of that transverse momentum.  Each plot is a bin where we integrated over a particular subset of the domain of *x*, *z*, and *Q*.  The blue lines are where the J/psi is produced from a quark inside the proton, and the red and green lines are two different ways the J/psi can be produced from a gluon inside the proton.  The purpose of making this plot was to identify bins in which one of these lines was dominant over the other.  For example, in the third bin the red and green lines are clearly dominant over the blue, while in the bottom row of plots the blue line is dominant.  Some conclusions you can draw from this include:

- If you are interested in production via a gluon, look at larger values of *z*, but smaller values of *x* and *Q*
- If you are interested in production via a quark, look at larger values of *x*
